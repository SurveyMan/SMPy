"""
The complex interactions between branching and blocking are what gives SurveyMan its sophisticated control flow.
SurveyMan supports the following branching policies:

- branch-one: Either this block directly contains a branch question, or one of its sub-blocks is a branch-one.

- branch-none: This block contains no branching questions. None of its sub-blocks are branch-one. Its sub-blocks may be
a mix of branch-none or branch-all with the NEXT pointer.

- branch-all: Every question in a block has branching logic associated with it. All questions must have equivalent
branch maps. This block cannot contain any sub-blocks.
