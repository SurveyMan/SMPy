SMPy
===========
SMPy is a Python front-end alternative to the SurveyMan Language and Runtime System. It is an intuitive way to programmatically generate SurveyMan survey instances. SMPy outputs a JSON representation of a survey that can be parsed by the SurveyMan [Language](http://surveyman.github.io/SurveyMan) and deployed by the Runtime System, [Runner](http://surveyman.github.io/Runner).

See `examples/example_survey.py` for how to use this library.
